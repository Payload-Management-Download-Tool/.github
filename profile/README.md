## 📌 About the App

**Payload Management** is a secure, auditable Windows application for packaging, signing, versioning and tracking firmware or test payloads in authorized environments.  
Built for device engineering teams, QA labs, and security researchers to manage payload lifecycles safely — from staging and simulation to approved deployment workflows.  
Focus is on traceability, role-based control, and non-destructive testing.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 📦 Package builder for payload bundles with metadata (version, target, checksum)  
- 🔐 Optional code signing integration
- 🧾 Audit logs: who built, who approved, who deployed (with timestamps)  
- 🌐 Optional integration hooks for CI pipelines (webhooks) and artifact stores  

---

## 💡 System Compatibility

Windows 10 / Windows 11 ✅  
Supports 64-bit architectures

---

## 🧩 How to Use (high-level, authorized scenarios only)

1. Create a new payload package and fill required metadata (name, version, target model).  
2. Run the **Applauncher.exe** to validate payload application in a sandbox environment — check logs and validation reports.   
3. Use **Deploy → Staging** to run a monitored deployment (non-destructive) before any field rollout.

## 📢 Operational Notes

- Mode is provided to reduce risk of accidental device harm; always validate in sandbox first.  
- Strongly recommend storing signing keys in a secure HSM or corporate key store; do not keep production signing keys on open developer machines.

---

## 🧠 Troubleshooting

- If signing fails, verify key permissions and network access to key store.  
- If simulator reports an integrity mismatch, re-generate package checksums and re-run the validation step.  
- For device connectivity issues, use the included diagnostic logs in **Help → Diagnostics** and attach logs when reporting bugs.
